## Data Collection
### Main
1. For the __Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis__, we mainly focus on [the SemEval shared tasks](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task5/)
(From this shared task you can go back to previous years related one, and from that task you can look at the best performing systems)
### Optional
2. The YelpZip data described here with link to [paper and code](http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/yelpzip-dataset/)
can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8JIKvhJUvRdfjBaaFB3TWQ1MEstQVpnb1ZDTUZkampJTUpQaEVZYVJmSUVZZS1xSkNJXzA)
